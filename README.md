# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Cancer Prediction on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset using Supervised Learning-Logistic Regression The Model have achieved 93% of accuracy.

This project implements Logistic Regression to classify breast tumors as malignant[0] or benign[1] using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. 

The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for medical diagnosis tasks.
